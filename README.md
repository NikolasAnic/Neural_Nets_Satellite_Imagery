# Neural_Nets_Satellite_Imagery
This is the Github Repository for the Google Colab file on CNN Assessments for Satellite Imagery using the EuroSat space data. It comprises of 10 different land categories. Aim of this project is to create an individual model based on 12 tuned hyperparameter characteristics, assess and compare the tuned model based on performance and time consumption with state-of-the-art transfer learning models (VGGNet and DenseNet201) and use different input data to improve the model class performance. Especially, we follow a relatively new approach to consider multiple colour band combinations (RGB being the most common, but also with NGR, NYB) to compare and assess class performance and find that using different colour bands can serve as important tool to better predict seemingly similar classes.
